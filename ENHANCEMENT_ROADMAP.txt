- **Data Model Design**: Comprehensive schema based on real financial advisor methodology
- **Foundation Before Features**: Database structure established before UI/features are built
- **Basic Before Advanced**: Simple multi-account support before complex scenario intelligence
- **Structure Before AI**: Data relationships established before AI integration layer

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Dependency-Optimized Order)
1. **Phase 0.1: Parse professional financial planning documents**: Extract account types, onboarding methodology, and user profile requirements ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Phase 0.2: Design comprehensive data model**: Account types, user profiles, scenario structure based on professional analysis

5. **Phase 3.1: Basic scenario framework**: Foundation for intelligent scenario system

**Ready to proceed with Phase 0.2 - Professional Financial Planning Analysis Complete!**

## REMAINING QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION
- **Professional Document Analysis**: ✅ Complete - Ready to proceed with Phase 0.2
- **Scenario Complexity**: Should we start with basic additive scenarios or dive straight into the sophisticated consequence modeling?
- **Demo Timeline**: How much time do you want to spend on this enhancement vs the original demo?
- **Account Types Priority**: Beyond checking, which accounts are most important? (Savings, Credit Card, Investment?)
- **BUST Scenario Sophistication**: How detailed should the initial "this won't work" analysis be?
