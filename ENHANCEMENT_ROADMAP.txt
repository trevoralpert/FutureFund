## DEPENDENCY-OPTIMIZED DEVELOPMENT RATIONALE
**Why This Order Prevents Rework:**
- **Phase 0 Research First**: NM documents inform account types, user profile structure, and onboarding flow
- **Data Model Design**: Comprehensive schema based on real financial advisor methodology
- **Foundation Before Features**: Database structure established before UI/features are built
- **Basic Before Advanced**: Simple multi-account support before complex scenario intelligence
- **Structure Before AI**: Data relationships established before AI integration layer

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Dependency-Optimized Order)
1. **Phase 0.1: Parse Northwestern Mutual PDFs**: Extract account types, onboarding methodology, and user profile requirements
2. **Phase 0.2: Design comprehensive data model**: Account types, user profiles, scenario structure based on NM analysis
3. **Phase 1.1: Implement database schema**: Multi-account foundation informed by Phase 0 research
4. **Phase 2.1: Build account management UI**: Basic multi-account interface
5. **Phase 3.1: Basic scenario framework**: Foundation for intelligent scenario system

**Ready to proceed with Phase 0.1 - Please provide Northwestern Mutual PDFs!**

## REMAINING QUESTIONS FOR CLARIFICATION
- **Northwestern Mutual PDFs**: Are you ready to share them now, or should we proceed with Phase 1.1 first?
- **Scenario Complexity**: Should we start with basic additive scenarios or dive straight into the sophisticated consequence modeling?
- **Demo Timeline**: How much time do you want to spend on this enhancement vs the original demo?
- **Account Types Priority**: Beyond checking, which accounts are most important? (Savings, Credit Card, Investment?)
- **BUST Scenario Sophistication**: How detailed should the initial "this won't work" analysis be?
