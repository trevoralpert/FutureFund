- **Intelligent Chat**: Natural language interface for financial questions
- **Real-time Updates**: Daily synchronization and projection updates
- **Desktop-First Experience**: Leverages local processing power for complex calculations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Electron + HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI API
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON/SQLite (MVP), future API integrations
- **Observability**: LangSmith/Langfuse for AI debugging
- **Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux)
