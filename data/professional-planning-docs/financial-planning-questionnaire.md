It is important that these investments match or exceed the rate of in˚ation.
 I am comfortable with 
  
  
moderate ˚uctuations in the value of these investments.
 
 
I am willing to tolerate small ˚uctuations in principal value to allow for the opportunity of my 
   
  
investments to grow at the same rate of in˚ation.
 
 
These assets should be safe,
 even if it means the returns do not keep pace with the rate of in˚ation.

The degree in which the value of an in
vestment increases and decreases is one measure of risk. More  
 
volatile in
vestments generally offer greater long-term growth potential than less volatile investments; 
  
 
how
ever, they may produce greater losses. With how much volatility are you comfortable?
 
 
I™m not comfortable with any volatility
.
 
 
I prefer to minimize volatility and focus on stability
.
 
 
I don™
t mind modest volatility to create a potential for growth.
 
 
I™m comfortable with moderate volatility to increase potential returns.
 
 
I expect substantial volatility in pursuit of higher returns.
